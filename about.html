                    <p>Biswanath received his B.Sc and M.Sc in Zoology from University of Calcutta, India. After finishing his
M.Sc in 2006, he joined the lab of Prof. Sandip K Bandyopadhyay at the Department of Biochemistry,
IPGME&amp;R Calcutta for PhD studies. His doctoral work was focused on dissecting the impact of
different biological modifiers in NSAID-induced gastric inflammation. After finishing PhD in 2010,
Biswanath moved to Prof. Rory A. Fisher’s laboratory at the Carver College of Medicine &amp; Holden
Comprehensive Cancer Centre at the University of Iowa, USA. His research focus was to dissect the
role of G-protein signalling and its regulators in physiology. Biswanath stayed in the same laboratory
for 4 years and 10 months. He is the recipient of independent American Heart Association (AHA)
postdoctoral fellowship, multiple international travel awards, best poster award at ASBMB and Junior
Scientist Award in Pharmacology (during postdoctoral tenure).
As a next career step, Biswanath returned to India at the age of 32 years with both prestigious
Ramalingaswami (DBT) and Ramanujan (DST) Fellowship leaving his AHA fellowship to start his
independent scientific career. He joined the Department of Zoology, University of Calcutta with
Ramalingaswami Fellowship in January 2015 and worked there for 2 years before he moved as
Assistant Professor to the Centre of Biomedical Research (CBMR), SGPGI Campus at Lucknow in
the beginning of 2017. He has currently 3 CSIR PhD students working with him. His research
laboratory is focused on the molecular understanding of different G-protein regulators in cancer and
cardiovascular phenotype.</p>

My research direction is to identify the impact of G5 protein in cardiovascular regulation. In addition, I am also working on how long term use of different NSAIDs can cause cardiovascular complications and the underlying G-protein dependent & independent mechanisms.  </p>
